  <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Siddharth Yayavaram</strong>.</p>

  <p>I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, graduating as the Institute <strong>Gold</strong> Medalist (Rank 1) with a GPA of 9.97/10.</p>

  <p>My research spans multimodal AI, LLM agents, evaluation, and culturally aware machine learning systems. For my undergraduate thesis, I collaborated with CMU and worked with Professor <strong><a href="https://www.phontron.com/" target="_blank">Graham Neubig</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://simran-khanuja.github.io/" target="_blank">Simran Khanuja</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://saxon.me/" target="_blank">Michael Saxon</a></strong> to build a system that augments vision-language models with information from a multilingual, multicultural knowledge base, improving performance on scoring images for cultural relevance. This work was accepted to CEGIS @ ICCV 2025 and EACL 2026 (main conference).</p>

  <p>My prior research has explored machine learning applications in mental health (speech data) and post-training language models for idiom classification and depression detection. I'm currently contributing to <strong>GameDevBench</strong>, a benchmark for evaluating agentic capabilities through game development.</p>

  <p>I'm always excited to collaborate on AI and NLP research. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together.</p>
